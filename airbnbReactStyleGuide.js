// Airbnb React/JSX Style Guide





// 1. Basic Rules
//  - Only include one React component per file.
//      - However, multiple Stateless, or Pure, Components are allowed per file. eslint: react/no-multi-comp
//  - Always use JSX syntax.
//  - Do not use React.createElement unless you're initializing the app from a file that is not JSX
//  - react/forbid-prop-types will allow arrays and objects only if it is explicitly noted what array and object contains, using arrayOf, objectOf, or shape.
